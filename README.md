## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1. **Dataset Overview** → Size, structure, and column definitions.  
2. **Missing Values Analysis** → Detection and handling of incomplete data.  
3. **User Demographics** → Age, gender, and country-based distributions.  
4. **App Categories** → Ratings and sentiment breakdown per app type.  
5. **Review Helpfulness** → Which reviews get the most upvotes.  
6. **Text & NLP Analysis** → Word clouds, n-gram analysis, sentiment polarity.  
7. **Multilingual Insights** → Reviews analyzed across multiple languages.

## 📊 Findings
- Majority of reviews are **positive**, but some categories (e.g., Dating, Travel & Local) show lower ratings.  
- **User gender** has little impact on ratings; **age groups** differ slightly, with younger users more polarized.  
- **Helpful reviews** tend to be detailed and critical, regardless of rating.  
- **Multilingual nature** of the dataset enables cross-language sentiment analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  
- **NLTK / TextBlob** for sentiment analysis  
- **WordCloud** for textual insights  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Advanced NLP with **transformer-based models** (mBERT, XLM-R).  
- **Topic modeling** (LDA, BERTopic) to detect user pain points.  
- **Time-series analysis** to track sentiment changes across app versions.
